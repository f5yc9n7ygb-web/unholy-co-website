# NOTE: NEXT_PUBLIC_* environment variables must be set in Cloudflare Pages Dashboard
# (Settings > Environment Variables) to be available at build time.
# The [vars] section in wrangler.toml is for runtime bindings only and won't work
# for build-time variable inlining that Next.js requires for NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables.
# 
# See CLOUDFLARE_ENV_SETUP.md for detailed instructions on setting up environment variables.
